In finance, momentum is the empirically observed tendency for rising asset prices or securities return to rise further, and falling prices to keep falling.
The idea is that a stock that performed well in the past is expected to continue performing well in the next period.
The existence of momentum is a market anomaly, which finance theory struggles to explain. 
Behavioral finance theory has discovered that investors are not perfectly rational and are subject to various cognitive biases that influence their decision-making

Skewness measures the asymmetry of returns. We can have positive skewness (many small losses and occasional large gains) and negative skewness (many small gains and occasional large losses)

In this project we want to put together momentum with skewness, using the cross-sectional approach.
It's been documented a strong relation between expected skewness and cross-sectional momentum profits.

Daniel and Moskowitz (2014) and Barroso and Santa-Clara (2015) showed that the returns of momentum investing are negatively skewed. 
Specifically, the return distribution of momentum is largely concentrated on the right side with fat tails.
